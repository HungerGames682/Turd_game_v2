Welcome to my game!!!! This game is... well i don't really know, i just got board one day and now here we are, Controles, WASD to move, and E to interace, very simple
There are still a crap ton of bugs in this game, so please don't abuse them, Not like anyone is going to play this
You goal is to make it to the next level, by going to that green looking cube somewhere on the map, that will take you to the first level
This NULl texture block will hurt you, try to stay clear, if you health hits zero, you will have to restart the game from the beginning, thats because I have yet to implement a check point system :)

These are a all the different texture blocks in the game, if they all look like NULL then the game is bugged and ricker is going to have to fix it

One last thing, those NUll blocks won't hurt you if your touching a wall, and thats not because ricker is taking advantage of a bug in the game and passing it off as a feature or anything...
